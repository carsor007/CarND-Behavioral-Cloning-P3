My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md summarizing the results

####2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

####3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

###Model Architecture and Training Strategy

####1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model consists of a convolution neural network with 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 32 and 128 (model.py lines 18-24) 

The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code line 20), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 18). 

####2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 21). 

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 10-16). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

####3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 25).

####4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ... 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

###Model Architecture and Training Strategy

####1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to copy the Nvidia neural network architecture. This network is purpose-built and ideal for the simulator.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model by adding dropout layers(model.py lines 131)

Then I trained and validated it on different datasets.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road.

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

####2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes.
 Below is a code snippet of my final model architecture.
 ```python
 # Crop 
model.add( Cropping2D( cropping=( (50,20), (0,0) ), input_shape=(160,320,3)))
#Normalize the data.
model.add( Lambda( lambda x: x/255. - 0.5 ) )
# Convolution Layers
model.add( Convolution2D( 24, 5, 5, subsample=(2,2), activation = 'relu' ) )
model.add( Convolution2D( 36, 5, 5, subsample=(2,2), activation = 'relu' ) )
model.add( Convolution2D( 48, 5, 5, subsample=(2,2), activation = 'relu' ) )
model.add( Convolution2D( 64, 3, 3, subsample=(1,1), activation = 'relu' ) )
model.add( Convolution2D( 64, 3, 3, subsample=(1,1), activation = 'relu' ) )
# Flatten for transition to fully connected layers.
model.add( Flatten() )
# Fully connected layers
model.add( Dense( 100 ) )
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add( Dense( 50 ) )
model.add( Dense( 10 ) )
model.add( Dense( 1 ) )
```
The model is described in the table below:

####3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center sThese images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

After the collection process, I had 8036 number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by normalizing, centering and cropping as shown in the model description above.

I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set.

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 5 as evidenced by convergence of the validation loss.. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
